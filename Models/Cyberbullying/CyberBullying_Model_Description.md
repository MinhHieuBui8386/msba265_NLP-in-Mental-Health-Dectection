# CyberBullying Model Description

This document provides a detailed description of the CyberBullying analysis model. The main focus is to explain the steps taken, their purpose, and how they contributed to the overall analysis and modeling process. The objective of this model is to identify instances of cyberbullying from a dataset of text data and develop an effective predictive framework.

---

## **Objective**
The main goal of this project is to analyze text data to detect cyberbullying behaviors. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning to classify text as indicating cyberbullying or not. Each step in this process is coded to enhance the accuracy of the model.

## **1. Libraries and Tools**

### **Imported Libraries**
- **pandas**: Used for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
- **matplotlib.pyplot** and **seaborn**: Essential for creating visualizations.
- **wordcloud**: Generates visual representations of text data, highlighting the most frequent terms.
- **nltk** (Natural Language Toolkit): Provides tools for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **re**: Facilitates text cleaning through pattern matching.
- **sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer**: Converts text data into numerical form for machine learning.
- **nltk.sentiment.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**: Assesses the emotional tone of text data as positive, negative or neutral.

### **Why These Tools?**
These tools are helpful for handling and analyzing text data. They simplify tasks such as cleaning, visualization, and model training. For example, `nltk` is critical for preparing raw text for machine learning by reducing noise, while `CountVectorizer` enables the transformation of text into a format that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

## **2. Data Loading**
The dataset was loaded from a CSV file containing two columns: `Text` and `Label`. The `Text` column holds the messages or comments, and the `Label` column contains binary values:
- **1**: Cyberbullying text.
- **0**: Non-Cyberbullying text.

### **Purpose**
Loading the data is the first step toward analyzing and understanding its structure. By organizing the data into a DataFrame, we can easily inspect, clean, and manipulate it for model analysis.

---

## **3. Data Inspection**
The dataset was inspected using methods like `info()` and `head()`. These steps help us to understand the size, structure, and completeness of the data.

### **Why is this Important?**
Understanding the dataset's structure is important for identifying missing values and determining the appropriate preprocessing steps. For example, the `Text` column contained a few missing values, which needed to be addressed before further analysis.

---

## **4. Label Distribution**
The distribution of labels was examined to assess the balance of the dataset. A balanced dataset ensures that machine learning models do not favor one class over another.

### **Purpose**
Balanced datasets are crucial for developing fair and unbiased models.

---

## **5. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Data cleaning involved removing unwanted characters, URLs, and other noise from the `Text` column. As the following steps:

### **Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Tokenization**: Text was split into individual words for further processing.
2. **Stopword Removal**: Common words with little semantic value (e.g., "the," "and") were removed.
3. **Lemmatization**: Words were reduced to their base forms to ensure consistency (e.g., "running" became "run").
4. **Vectorization**: Text was transformed into numerical data using `CountVectorizer`.

### **Purpose**
These preprocessing steps reduce noise and standardize the data, making it suitable for machine learning. For example, lemmatization helps group similar words, reducing redundancy and improving the model’s ability to generalize.

## **6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset. Techniques included:
- **Visualizing Label Distribution**: To understand the proportion of cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying instances.
- **Generating Word Clouds**: This visualization was used to highlight common terms in each class.

### **Purpose**
EDA helps in understanding patterns and trends in the data. such as, word clouds reveal frequently used terms in cyberbullying messages, providing context for feature extraction.

---

## **7. Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis was conducted using `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` to evaluate the emotional tone of text samples. This step added an additional layer of understanding by categorizing messages into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

### **Why Sentiment Analysis?**
Cyberbullying often carries a negative tone. Sentiment scores can act as features in the machine learning model, improving its ability to detect harmful content.

---

## **8. Machine Learning Process**
The dataset was used to train machine learning models. The process included:
1. **Feature Extraction**: `CountVectorizer` converted text into numerical vectors.
2. **Data Splitting**: The data was divided into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Classifiers such as Logistic Regression were trained to predict labels.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to assess model performance.

### **Purpose**
Machine learning enables the automated classification of text into cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying categories. Splitting the data ensures that the model’s performance is evaluated on unseen data, providing a realistic estimate of its accuracy.

# Machine Learning Process

The machine learning step involved the implementation of multiple models to achieve the highest accuracy in detecting cyberbullying. Each model and its contribution are explained clearly below:

## **8.1 Feature Extraction**

- **CountVectorizer** was used to convert text data into numerical features. This method creates a sparse matrix representation of text by counting word frequencies.

- **BERT Embeddings**: Advanced feature extraction was performed using pre-trained BERT models, which capture the contextual meaning of words. These embeddings provided richer and more informative features for classification.

## **8.2 Data Splitting**

The dataset was split into training and testing subsets (e.g., 80%-20%). Splitting ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data for realistic performance assessment.

## **8.3 Models Used**

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - A baseline model for classification.
  - Easy to interpret and quick to train.
  - **Purpose**: Establish a basic performance  for the dataset.

- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - learning method that uses multiple decision trees.
  - **Purpose**: Capture non-linear relationships and improve model against overfitting.

- **BERT-based Transformer Model**:
  - Used the pre-trained BERT architecture to extract deep contextual embeddings from the text.
  - Fine-tuned on the dataset to optimize performance for cyberbullying detection.
  - **Purpose**: To achieve  accuracy by understanding the semantic and contextual parts in the data.

- **Support Vector Classifier (SVM)**:
  - Effective for high-dimensional data.
  - **Purpose**: Provide an alternative linear and non-linear classification approach.

- **Naive Bayes**:
  - Used for quick text classification.
  - **Purpose**: Compare performance with modeling.

## **8.4 Evaluation Metrics**

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Evaluates how many of the predicted positive labels are true positives.
- **Recall**: Assesses how well the model identifies all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score**: Combines precision and recall to provide a balanced metric.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to analyze model performance.

## **8.5 Results**

- **BERT-based Model**:
  - Achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score.
  - Most effective in capturing contextual parts of text.

- **Random Forest**:
  - Robust performance but slightly less accurate than BERT.

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Established a strong performance but lacked the ability to handle complex patterns in text.

- **Other Models**:
  - SVM and Naive Bayes performed reasonably well but were less effective than deep learning approaches.

## **9. Model Performance**

The BERT-based model achieved the highest overall accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in classifying text data. Precision and recall metrics confirmed that the model could identify cyberbullying instances without significant false positives or false negatives. Random Forest and Logistic Regression also performed well but did not match the contextual understanding provided by BERT.

## **Conclusion**

This project highlights the importance of natural language processing and machine learning in detecting cyberbullying. Each step, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, contributed to building an accurate predictive model. The balanced dataset, combined with robust preprocessing and feature extraction techniques, played a key role in the model’s success. The inclusion of BERT further enhanced accuracy.
